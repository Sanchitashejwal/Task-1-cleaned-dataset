# Medical Appointment Dataset â€“ Data Cleaning Report

## Introduction  
This report provides an overview of the cleaning and formatting changes made to the **Medical Appointment Dataset**.

## Changes Made  

### 1. Removing Unnecessary Spaces  
- Trimmed extra spaces in columns like **Neighbourhood** to ensure consistency.

### 2. Standardizing Text Formatting  
- Converted all uppercase names to **Title Case** (e.g., `JARDIM DA PENHA` â†’ `Jardim Da Penha`).

### 3. Fixing Special Character Issues  
- Fixed corrupted characters in **Neighbourhood names** (e.g., `REPÃƒBLICA` â†’ `REPÃšBLICA`).

### 4. Checking Gender Column for Consistency  
- Ensured all values in **Gender** were either `Male` or `Female`.

### 5. Formatting Numerical Data  
- Checked **Age, PatientId, and AppointmentId** to ensure they only contained numbers.

### 6. Verifying Date Formatting  
- Made sure **ScheduledDay** and **AppointmentDay** were in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format.

### 7. Standardizing Categorical Values  
- Verified binary columns (**Scholarship, Hypertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism, Handicap**) contained only `0` or `1`.
